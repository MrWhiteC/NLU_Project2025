**4. Introducing a New Dataset for Event Detection in Cybersecurity Texts**

**Problem Statement:**  
- Cybersecurity event detection (ED) involves identifying trigger words that indicate cybersecurity events in text. Existing datasets, such as CASIE (Cybersecurity and Attack Strategies for Information Extraction), have limited event types (5 types) and do not consider document-level context, making them insufficient for real-world cybersecurity ED. To address these limitations, the paper introduces CySecED, a new dataset that covers more event types and requires document-level context for accurate detection.

**Key Contributions:**  
- **New Dataset (CySecED):** Introduces a manually annotated dataset with 30 cybersecurity event types, significantly expanding on CASIE.
- **Comprehensive Model Evaluation:** Compares sentence-level and document-level ED models, showing the importance of document context.
- **Challenges & Insights:** Identifies key challenges in cybersecurity event annotation, including trigger ambiguity and domain expertise requirements.
- **Future Research Directions:** Highlights the need for better document-aware architectures, domain-adapted embeddings, and event argument annotation.

**Methodology:** 
- **Dataset Collection:** Extracted cybersecurity news articles from The Hacker News (THN) and selected 30 event types based on the Simmons et al. (2014) cyberattack taxonomy.
- **Annotation Process:** Two annotators with security expertise labeled event trigger words, achieving Cohenâ€™s Kappa = 0.79 after expert review.
- **Model Evaluation:** Tested sentence-level models (CNN, DMCNN, MOGANED, BERT-ED) and document-level models (HBTNGMA, DEEB-RNN) using word2vec and BERT embeddings.

**Conclusion:**
CySecED is a newly introduced dataset for cybersecurity event detection (ED), addressing the limitations of CASIE by expanding event types from 5 to 30 and incorporating document-level context. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals that current ED systems struggle with CySecED, with the best model achieving only 68.4% F1, far below human performance (81.0% F1). The results highlight the need for document-aware architectures and domain-adapted embeddings to improve cybersecurity ED. Future work includes event argument annotation and the exploration of advanced deep learning models. CySecED will be publicly released to support further research in NLP for cybersecurity.

**Relevance to Our Project:**

**Methodology:** 
- **Data Collection:** The researchers gather cybersecurity event data and related queries from existing systems. This forms the basis for training the hybrid model and understanding the requirements of the cybersecurity domain.
- **Rule-Based Translation:** Initially, a rule-based approach is used to translate predefined, simple queries into system-specific queries that can be processed by the cybersecurity event collection system.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** As more queries are processed, machine learning techniques are applied to refine and expand the system's understanding, enabling it to handle more complex, nuanced natural language queries.
