# AI Chatbot for MITRE ATT&CK Threat Classification and Organizational Impact Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to develop an **AI-powered chatbot** that leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to classify cybersecurity news articles into **MITRE ATT&CK techniques** and assess their potential impact on organizations. The chatbot will utilize **fine-tuned transformer models** (e.g., BERT, GPT) for threat classification and integrate **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide organization-specific threat assessments. The goal is to automate threat intelligence, improve incident response times, and enhance decision-making for cybersecurity teams.


## Key Features
- **Automated Threat Classification:** The chatbot will classify cybersecurity news articles into MITRE ATT&CK techniques using fine-tuned NLP models.

- **Organization-Specific Impact Analysis:** By integrating RAG, the chatbot will retrieve relevant information from organizational documents to provide tailored threat assessments.

- **Real-Time Threat Analysis:** A web-based interface will allow users to input cybersecurity news and receive immediate feedback on ATT&CK techniques classification and organizational impact.

- **Comparative Model Analysis:** The project will compare the performance of different NLP models (e.g., BERT, GPT, LSTMs) in classifying cybersecurity threats and use the best one.
